# React-Native demo app
This is a toy app to try out react-native

## Preliminary
### node.js & npm
If you don't have node, and npm installed, follow these steps.

- NVM
use cURL: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash`
or use Wget: `wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash`

- node.js
Install node.js: `nvm install v5.7.0`

- Xcode
Go to app store and download Xcode, the full version.

- React-native
Install the react-native cli tool: `npm install -g react-native-cli`

Now you are good to go.

## To try this app
Clone this app to your local machine, go to the root directory of the repo, then:
- run `react-native run-ios`.
- Or you can open up xcode, and navigate to the `./ios` directory under root dir of this repo, and open the `.xcodeproj` file.
